# Shape Illusions

This project creates various shapes using the Python `turtle` graphics library to demonstrate shape illusions.

## Overview

The script generates multiple shapes with different colors and positions on the screen to create visual illusions. The shapes and their positions are predefined, and the script uses the `turtle` library to draw these shapes on the screen.

## Features

- **Upper Pink Section**: A complex shape filled with pink color.
- **Lower Light Blue Section**: A complementary shape filled with light blue color.
- **Corner Dark Blue Sections**: Smaller shapes in the corners filled with dark blue color.
- **Middle Shapes**: Various shapes including a light blue shape, a pink pentagon, green quadrilaterals, and red triangles.
- **Text**: Displays "SHAPE ILLUSIONS" in multiple colors.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute `Shape Illusions.py` in a Python environment. Ensure that the `turtle` library is installed.

```sh
python Shape\ Illusions.py
